# Detecting COVID-19 in X-ray images 

Like most people around the world right now, we are worried about COVID-19. 
But instead of sitting on the sidelines and doing nothing about the Covid pandemic,
we have decided to focus on aspects that can address this problem or at least give a glimmer of hope. 
As a result, an application was created that could detect COVID-19 in X-ray images. 

We conducted experiments to detect and classify COVID-19 using X-ray images in two different scenarios :  
1 scenarios: Transfer Learning  (File : covid19WithDeepLearning.ipynb)  
2 scenarios: Classic Machine learning Algo (File : covid19WithML.ipynb) ,   
We use the first layer (cnn) to extract features from images then we use a classic Machine Learning model (xgboost,svm, ...)
